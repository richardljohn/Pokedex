# Pokedex

This is a Pokédex. In the anime, Pokémon, the Earth contains creatures called Pokémon. There are hundreds and hundreds of different species of Pokémon. Each species is different from each other primarily in name and elemental typing. 

In the anime there is a device called a Pokédex. The Pokédex is a database that holds the information of every Pokémon. 
This code is essentially a Pokédex of only one generation of Pokémon. 

It is a simple code that when ran, will display the name, Pokédex number, and typing of each Pokémon. 

The code does not use a database but focuses on loading and reading files that contains the information of each Pokémon that will be displayed.
